These tools implement in R a fundamental part of
the software PACTA (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
portfolios and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
Financial institutions use PACTA to study how their capital
allocation impacts the climate. This package matches data from
financial portfolios to asset level data from market-intelligence
databases (e.g. power plant capacities, emission factors, etc.). This
is the first step to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with
climate goals.

## Installation

Before you install r2dii.match you may want to:

* [Try an rstudio.cloud project with this package already installed](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1424833).
* [Learn how to minimize installation errors](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation).

When you are ready, install the released version of r2dii.match from CRAN with:

```r
# install.packages("r2dii.match")
```

Or install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

[How to raise an issue?](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-06-26-instructions-to-raise-an-issue/)

## Example

```{r}
library(r2dii.data)
library(r2dii.match)
```

Matching is achieved in two main steps:

### 1. Run fuzzy matching

`match_name()` will extract all unique counterparty names from the columns: `direct_loantaker`, `ultimate_parent` or `intermediate_parent*` and run fuzzy matching against all company names in the `ald`:

```{r}
match_result <- match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo)
match_result 
```

### 2. Prioritize validated matches

The user should then manually validate the output of [match_name()], ensuring that the value of the column `score` is equal to `1` for perfect matches only.

Once validated, the `prioritize()` function, will choose only the valid matches, prioritizing (by default) `direct_loantaker` matches over `ultimate_parent` matches: 

```{r}
prioritize(match_result)
```

The result is a dataset with identical columns to the input loanbook, and added columns bridging all matched loans to their ald counterpart.
